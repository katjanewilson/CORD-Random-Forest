## CORD Random Forest {.tabset}

### Overview

Simulation of assymetric loss in random forest algorithm, inspired by the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge

Using open data collected from Kaggle, I develop a forecasting tool to predict likelihood of COVID deaths, and use the tool to demonstrate how changes in sampling affect assymetric loss.

Open data on Kaggle includes over 2000 observations of individuals in South Korea who attended the hospital for COVID-19 from late 2019 to early 2020.

### Data Cleaning
The original dataset contained 2119 entries of patients and 18 variables. Multiple variables contained missing values. The sex variable included 230 missing values. In order to keep the information that would be lost if list wise deletion were employed, I coded these values as “absent”. Likewise, I recode the order variable with 4, the most common present order, if missing. For variables missing the age, values of 25 were imputed in missing values, since 25 was the most frequently observed age, and the provided variable does not give insight into the distribution of ages between decades. After this recoding, 2 variables remained missing from the outcome of interest, the State 3 variable. Looking into these two variables, both their State 2 values were “Lived”, so I recode State 3 to released for these two observations. Limitations to this approach of recoding are that the values imputed could stray from the true values of these variables, and that something explaining the missingness could contribute to the outcomes for these observations.
In choosing the predictors for the final model, the birth year variable, which is already captured in the age variable is left out of the model. Additionally, the country variable, which only 12 values are from outside Korea is left out of the analysis data set, since, with such a small number outside of Korea, no cases may end up being sampled in the random forest. Likewise, dates of infection and symptom onset, with no knowledge of how the data were collected could be subject to much bias, and these are left out. The final random forest model includes the predictors Order, Sex, Province, Age, and confirmed date.

### Random Forest
The recoded analysis data contains 32 individuals who were deceased, 1813 isolated, and 274 released from the hospital. The related proportions are 1.51% deceased, 85.60% isolated, and 12.93% released. Table 1 classifies the OOB estimates in our random forest model through a confusion matrix. The algorithm’s forecasting accuracy can improve upon the previously stated forecasts at baseline that may be made by a doctor without such a tool. Additionally, the algorithm can take into account cost ratios, whereas the baseline forecasts do not take these into account. Stakeholders expressed the highest
concern in releasing a patient who is the most risk of death, and hoped to make false negatives 20 times more costly than false positives. Likewise, stakeholders were next concerned about putting a patient in isolation who would actually need a ventilator. They weighted this as 10:1 false negative to false positive ratio. Other stakeholders may be concerned about too many false positives in this direction, if they
 are concerned about misallocating ventilator resources to people who do not need them. However, the stakeholders in this country noted that ventilators were not yet used to capacity, since many countries have been donating their old ventilators as the peak of the crisis has hit in some countries. Therefore, these stakeholders requested a 10:1 cost ratio. Finally, the stakeholders noted that the current medical systems who would use such a tool have already implemented strict shelter in place and social distancing orders, so the cost of releasing someone who was contagious, and needed to be isolated, was the least lopsided cost ratio requested, and stakeholders intended for this ratio to be 2:1.

 Sample Code
```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
rf <- randomForest(outcome~Sex + Age + Province + Source +
                     Order, data=coronavirus_data,
                   importance = TRUE,
                   sampsize = c(21,12,26)) #example of asymmetric sampling
print(rf)
```


Various cost ratios of false negatives to false positives were applied to the stratified sampling procedure with replacement. The sample of the deceased was set to 21, and after that, adjustments were made to sample the isolated and released in response. Table 1 is the confusion matrix from the OOB estimates. Because there is a large imbalance in outcome distribution (less than 2% of individuals die from the disease), then it is difficult to arrive at fully sensible cost ratios through the sampling method. Table 2 is
 the confusion table for deaths and released. The intent was to make a false negative death 20 more costly than a false positive. Stakeholders noted that a false negative death predicted to be a released would be the most costly decision possible, and avoided at the highest costs. The confusion table from the OOB estimates shows the random forest classification avoided all false negatives in this case. Table 3 is the confusion table for deceased and isolated. The intent was to make a false negative death 10 times as
 costly, and the confusion table shows a larger ratio at 20 to 1, achieved due to the high number of people isolated, and under-sampling from this parameter. Table 4 is the confusion table for the released and isolated, which was asked by stakeholders to be the situation that could be the closest to a 1:1 cost ratio. The ratio intended by stakeholders was to be a ratio of 2:1, and the actual ratio that result was around 1.2 to 1. The tradeoff makes sense, because this is
 the decision with the least repercussions, according to stakeholders. Stakeholders noted that failing to identify someone who should have been isolated as having been released, then they are likely to go back
    into their communities and be isolated anyways, with such protective measures and stay at home orders already in place.
    
    
Without such a tool, knowing that 1.5% of individuals die, then if a non-death is forecast, it would be correct 98% of the time and a death forecast would be correct 1.5% of the time. Our goal is to do better, because
 false negatives are costly, and the stakeholders (the doctors trying to save lives) will accept more false positives in order to decrease the number of false negatives. That is why the policy makers weight the cost of a false negative death so highly, their number one goal is to save lives.
 
The classification accuracy on the right side of the table shows that the random forest gets those who die classified correctly greater than 80% of the time, so a majority of these rare events are classified
correctly. The forecasting accuracy, on the other hand, depends on the cost ratio. A forecast of deceased is correct 19% of the time. That may seem small, but it is a jump from our previous ability to forecast the deceased at 1.5%. Another way to look at this would be that we avoided the worst type of forecasting error, which would be to forecast someone who died as being released. Likewise, our ability to forecast the isolated and released raise to 92% and 53%, respectively, and both are improvements from baseline. This has the other effect of increasing the number of false positives of those who are forecasted to die, which was a tradeoff accepted by policy makers and stakeholders, whose previous forecasts, without an algorithm, did not take cost benefits into account.

### Evaluation
We can assess the contribution of variables to the single outcome class of death. When the variable of Province is shuffled, classification accuracy for a death declines by around 35% points. Age, source, and confirmed are less important. However, such importance measures are smaller because they now include categories that have more cases (released and isolated). Although confirmed date is now more important according to the reshuffling, the average overall classification accuracy is of less interest than the importance based on a single outcome. Policy makers might note that the variable of Province strongly contributes to the forecasting skill of the algorithm in forecasting death. This insight may go against what is currently accepted in the research on COVID-19. Many policy makers focus on age as associated with death in infected patients, but these plots show that province is more important in forecasting deaths, at least for the sample at hand. Of course, the variable importance plot does not show how an input is related to the response. The functional form is not revealed, and policy makers should understand that these analyses to not explain why or how province is an important predictor of death, simply that it improves forecasting accuracy.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
###variable importance plots
par(mfrow = c(2,2))

varImpPlot(rf, class = 1, type = 1, scale = FALSE, 
           main = "Fig 1.1: Forecasting Importance Plot for Deceased")
varImpPlot(rf, type = 1, scale = FALSE, 
           main = "Fig 1.2: Forecasting Importance Plot Averaged for All")
```


Unlike variable independence plots, the response functions in partial plots are made separately for each predictor and each outcome category. Partial plots demonstrate how each predictor is related to the response when the other predictors are held constant. Figure 2.1 is the partial response plot for the outcome of death and the predictor of age. Similar to the prevailing narrative and research, the plot confirms that chances of death increases with age, and policy makers, after converting these logits to probabilities, will find that age is strongly associated with death. The partial response plots for the released and isolated variables differ since only one outcome can occur at a time, though both show a similar downward trend with increasing age. Likewise, the partial plots picture in Figures 3.1-3.4 for the categorical variables, show the relationship between the input of categorical variables with the log odds of death. Policy makers may be interested in how death varies with a particular province, order, or source, and can likewise reframe these logit odds into probabilities to find out the association of changes in the death outcome.


```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE, echo = TRUE}
part1<- partialPlot(rf, pred.data = coronavirus_data, x.var = "Age",
                    rug = T, which.class = 1)
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
#tranform the logs back to probablity
scatter.smooth(part1$x, part1$y, xlab = "Age",
               ylab = "Centered Log Odds of Death", main = "Fig 2.1: Partial Dependence Plot for Death on Age")

par(mfrow = c(2,2))
part2 <- partialPlot(rf, pred.data = coronavirus_data,
                     x.var = Sex, reg = T, prob = T,which.class = 1 ,
                     main = "Fig 3.1: Partial Dependence Plot for Death on Sex",
                     xlab = "Sex", ylab = "Centered Log Odds of Death")
```


Random forest algorithms aggregate the votes across trees for each outcome class in the spirit of bootstrap aggregation. When the vote percentages are large one way or the other, then the algorithm is classifying with high reliability (it may not be accurate, but it is reliable). However, when the vote percentages are nearly identical, little reliability is present in the outcome class. The maximum
4
proportion of times that a case is classified correctly, and a maximum proportion of times it is classified incorrectly, are compared to find the margin. The larger the margin, the more confident the classification.
Figure 4.2 maps the margin for a deceased classification onto a histogram. A majority of the classifications have margins greater than 0.5. Very few are close to the 0.0 mark, and these that are sway towards the negative direction. Five votes in total were classified incorrectly, and two of these with reliability over 0.5. The margin here is lopsided in favor of the correct class, so despite the noise introduced by bagging resampling, most of the time the cases are classified correctly, and the classification is highly reliable in the valid (right) direction for the death outcome.
Since the purpose of our tool is for forecasting, then the stakeholders are most likely interested in the forecasting error, which show when projections are likely to be correct. In the same vein, looking at the margins for the other two outcomes (released and isolated), the distributions are less strongly skewed in the same way that the distribution for the outcome of death was. The algorithm is less reliable in these forecasts, which, as mentioned, is complemented by the forecasting accuracy. Since there is no line in the sand way to determine reliability, then again decision makers should be the ones to also decide on how decisive a vote should be for classification in respective outcomes.

Limitations of the analysis include omitted variables. One can imagine many other possible variables as predictive of the outcome that were not collected in the dataset at hand. Additionally, the random forest cannot be extended to forecasts beyond the data at hand, since the data is not IID.
Perhaps the biggest point of pause, however, is the very high cost ratio that was achieved in the outcome of deceased and isolated (Table 3). Although the policy makers asked for a high cost ratio since doctors are hoping to save as many lives as possible, this may change in the future as more and more individuals enter the hospital, and less resources are available. As resources become more scarce, then the costs of a false positive (classifying someone as high risk who actually can just be isolated) may become costlier, and the stakeholders will actually prefer to take on more false negatives in this category. In this case, the parameters can be re-sampled at different rates to achieve the desired cost ratio.
The task was to improve upon decisions that were already being made by doctors and nurses who received COVID-19 cases in the ER. Despite the difficulty in obtaining the exact cost ratios that were requested by policy officials, the model provides forecasts that are superior to baseline practice. Additionally, the model accounts for the cost ratios that were requested by policy makers, which prior baseline practices did not take into account. Such a tool could be used in conjunction with the expertise of doctors and nurses in the field for allocating COVID-19 patients proper resources.
