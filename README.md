# COVID-19 Prediction Tool

Central to the debate of ethical algorithm design is a consideration of mis-classification costs for supervised learning methods. By building in asymmetric costs through sampling, machine learning engineers can take heed of policy makers’ desired cost-ratios. This random forest algorithm takes asymmetric sampling into account when predicting death rates of coronavirus patients in South Korea using the Kaggle COVID-19 Open Research Dataset.

## How It Works

1. Step1
2. Step 2
3. The `webpack` plugin creates an empty webpack project, adds your library
   and looks for the bundle size difference.
4. The `time` plugin compares the current machine performance with that of
   a low-priced Android devices to calculate the CPU throttling rate.
5. Then the `time` plugin runs headless Chrome (or desktop Chrome if it’s
   available) to track the time a browser takes to compile and execute your JS.
