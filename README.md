# COVID-19 Prediction Tool

Central to the debate of ethical algorithm design is a consideration of mis-classification costs for supervised learning methods. By building in asymmetric costs through sampling, machine learning engineers can take heed of policy makers’ desired cost-ratios. This random forest algorithm takes asymmetric sampling into account when predicting death rates of coronavirus patients in South Korea using the Kaggle COVID-19 Open Research Dataset.

## How It Works

1. Size Limit contains a CLI tool, 3 plugins (`file`, `webpack`, `time`)
   and 3 plugin presets for popular use cases (`app`, `big-lib`, `small-lib`).
   A CLI tool finds plugins in `package.json` and loads the config.
2. If you use the `webpack` plugin, Size Limit will bundle your JS files into
   a single file. It is important to track dependencies and webpack polyfills.
   It is also useful for small libraries with many small files and without
   a bundler.
3. The `webpack` plugin creates an empty webpack project, adds your library
   and looks for the bundle size difference.
4. The `time` plugin compares the current machine performance with that of
   a low-priced Android devices to calculate the CPU throttling rate.
5. Then the `time` plugin runs headless Chrome (or desktop Chrome if it’s
   available) to track the time a browser takes to compile and execute your JS.
